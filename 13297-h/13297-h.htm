    <h4>(<i>Condensed and Revised Version by Mr. P.'s Own Harmless
    Ibsenite.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. II.-NORA; OR, THE BIRD-CAGE (ET DIKKISVÖIT).</h3>

    <h4>ACT I.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>A Room tastefully filled with cheap Art-furniture.
        Gimcracks in an étagère; a festoon of chenille monkeys
        hanging from the gaselier. Japanese fans, skeletons,
        cotton-wool spiders, frogs, and lizards, scattered
        everywhere about. Drain-pipes with tall dyed grasses. A
        porcelain stove decorated with transferable pictures.
        Showily-bound books in book-case. Window. The Visitors'
        bell rings in the hall outside. The hall-door is heard to
        open, and then to shut. Presently</i> NORA <i>walks in with
        parcels; a Porter carries a large Christmas-tree after
        her&mdash;which he puts down</i>. NORA <i>gives him a
        shilling&mdash;and he goes out grumbling</i>. NORA <i>hums
        contentedly, and eats macaroons. Then</i> HELMER <i>puts
        his head out of his Manager's room, and</i> NORA <i>hides
        macaroons cautiously.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>playfully</i>). Is that my little squirrel
    twittering&mdash;that my lark frisking in here?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Ess! (<i>To herself.</i>) I have only been
    married eight years, so these marital amenities have not yet
    had time to pall!</p>

    <div class="figright"

             alt="'Boo!'" /></a>"Boo!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>threatening with his finger</i>). I hope
    the little bird has surely not been digging its beak into any
    macaroons, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>bolting one, and wiping her mouth</i>). No,
    most certainly not. (<i>To herself</i>.) The worst of being so
    babyish is&mdash;one <i>does</i> have to tell such a lot of
    taradiddles! (<i>To H.</i>) See what <i>I</i>'ve
    bought&mdash;it's been <i>such</i> fun!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Hums.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>inspecting parcels</i>). H'm&mdash;rather
    an <i>expensive</i> little lark!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Takes her playfully by the ear.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Little birds like to have a flutter
    occasionally. Which reminds me&mdash;(<i>Plays with his
    coat-buttons.</i>) I'm such a simple ickle sing&mdash;but if
    you <i>are</i> thinking of giving me a Christmas present, make
    it cash.</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Just like your poor father, <i>he</i> always
    asked me to make it cash&mdash;he never made any himself! It's
    heredity, I suppose. Well&mdash;well!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Goes back to his Bank</i>. NORA <i>goes on
        humming.</i></p>

        <p><i>Enter</i> Mrs. LINDEN, <i>doubtfully.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. What, CHRISTINA&mdash;why, how old you look!
    But then you are poor. I'm not. TORVALD has just been made a
    Bank Manager. (<i>Tidies the room.</i>) Isn't it really
    wonderfully delicious to be well off? But, of course, you
    wouldn't know. <i>We</i> were poor once, and, do you know, when
    TORVALD was ill, I&mdash;(<i>tossing her head</i>)&mdash;though
    I <i>am</i> such a frivolous little squirrel, and all that, I
    actually borrowed £300 for him to go abroad. Wasn't <i>that</i>
    clever? Tra-la-la! I shan't tell you <i>who</i> lent it. I
    didn't even tell TORVALD. I am such a mere baby I don't tell
    him everything. I tell Dr. RANK, though. Oh, I'm so awfully
    happy I should like to shout, "Dash it all!"</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Linden</i> (<i>stroking her hair</i>). Do&mdash;it
    is a natural and innocent outburst&mdash;you are such a child!
    But I am a widow, and want employment. <i>Do</i> you think your
    husband could find me a place as clerk in his Bank?
    (<i>Proudly.</i>) I am an excellent knitter!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. That would really be awfully funny. (<i>To</i>
    HELMER, <i>who enters.</i>) TORVALD, this is CHRISTINA; she
    wants to be a clerk in your Bank&mdash;<i>do</i> let her! She
    thinks such a lot of <i>you</i>. (<i>To herself.</i>) Another
    taradiddle!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. She is a sensible woman, and deserves
    encouragement. Come along, Mrs. LINDEN, and we'll see what we
    can do for you.</p>

    <p>[<i>He goes out through the hall with</i> Mrs. L., <i>and
    the front-door is heard to slam after them.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>opens door, and calls</i>). Now, EMMY, IVAR,
    and BOB, come in and have a romp with Mamma&mdash;we will play
    hide-and-seek. (<i>She gets under the table, smiling in quiet
    satisfaction</i>; KROGSTAD <i>enters</i>&mdash;NORA <i>pounces
    out upon him</i>). Boo!... Oh, I <i>beg</i> your pardon. I
    don't do this kind of thing <i>generally</i>&mdash;though I may
    be a little silly!</p>

    <p><i>Krogstad</i> (<i>politely</i>). Don't mention it. I
    called because I happened to see your husband go out with MRS.
    LINDEN&mdash;from which, being a person of considerable
    penetration, I infer that he is about to give her my post at
    the Bank. Now, as you owe me the balance of £300, for which I
    hold your acknowledgment, you will see the propriety of putting
    a stop to this little game at once.</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. But I don't at all&mdash;not a little wee bit!
    I'm so childish, you know&mdash;why <i>should</i> I?
    [<i>Sitting upright on carpet.</i></p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> I will try to make it plain to the meanest
    capacity. When you came to me for the loan, I naturally
    required some additional security. Your father, being a shady
    Government official, without a penny&mdash;for, if he had
    possessed one, he would, presumably, have left it to
    you&mdash;without a penny, then, I, as a cautious man of
    business, insisted upon having his signature as a surety. Oh,
    we Norwegians are sharp fellows!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. Well, you <i>got</i> Papa's signature, didn't
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> Oh, I <i>got</i> it right enough.
    Unfortunately, it was dated three days after his
    decease&mdash;now, how do you account for <i>that</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. How? Why, as poor Papa was dead, and couldn't
    sign, I signed <i>for</i> him, that's all! Only somehow I
    forgot to put the date back. <i>That's</i> how. Didn't I
    <i>tell</i> you I was a silly, unbusinesslike little thing?
    It's very simple.</p>

    <p><i>Krogs.</i> Very&mdash;but what you did amounts to
    forgery, notwithstanding. I happen to know, because I'm a
    lawyer, and have done a little in the forging way myself. So,
    to come to the point&mdash;if <i>I</i> get kicked out, I shall
    not go alone! [<i>He bows, and goes out.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. It <i>can't</i> be wrong! Why no one but
    KROGSTAD would have been taken in by it! If the Law says it's
    wrong, the Law's a goose&mdash;a bigger goose than poor little
    me even! (<i>To</i> HELMER, <i>who enters</i>.) Oh, TORVALD,
    how you made me jump!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Has anybody called? (NORA <i>shakes her
    head</i>.) Oh, my little squirrel mustn't tell naughty
    whoppers! Why, I just met that fellow KROGSTAD in the hall.
    He's been asking you to get me to take him back&mdash;now,
    hasn't he?</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>walking about</i>). Do just see how pretty
    the Christmas-tree looks!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. Never mind the tree&mdash;I want to have this
    out about KROGSTAD. I can't take him back, because many years
    ago he forged a name. As a lawyer, a close observer of human
    nature, and a Bank Manager, I have remarked that people who
    forge names seldom or never confide the fact to their
    children&mdash;which inevitably brings moral contagion into the
    entire family. From which it follows, logically, that KROGSTAD
    has been poisoning his children for years by acting a part, and
    is morally lost. (<i>Stretches out his hands to her.</i>) I
    can't bear a morally lost Bank-cashier about me!</p>

    <p><i>Nora</i>. But you never thought of dismissing him till
    CHRISTINA came!</p>

    <p><i>Helmer</i>. H'm! I've got some business to attend
    to&mdash;so good-bye, little lark! [<i>Goes into office and
    shuts door.</i></p>

    <p><i>Nora</i> (<i>pale with terror</i>). If KROGSTAD poisons
    his children because he once forged a name, I must be poisoning
    EMMY, and BOB, and IVAR, because <i>I</i> forged Papa's
    signature! (<i>Short pause; she raises her head proudly.</i>)
    After all, if I <i>am</i> a doll, I can still draw a logical
    induction! I mustn't play with the children any
    more&mdash;(<i>hotly</i>)&mdash;I don't care&mdash;I
    <i>shall</i>, though! Who cares for KROGSTAD?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She makes a face, choking with suppressed tears, as
        Curtain falls.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>N.B.&mdash;The tremendous psychological problem of whether
    NORA is as much of a doll, a squirrel, and a lark, as she
    seems, and if so, whether it is her own fault, or HELMER's or
    Society's, will be solved in subsequent numbers.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.&mdash;At last by the authority of
    the L.C.C. his Grace of BEDFORD has been notified that within
    three months from now "Locks, bolts, and bars must fly asunder"
    in the parish of St. Pancras, where henceforth existence of all
    such obstruction is to cease. We hope that the gate-keepers,
    whose occupation is gone, have been amply provided for, as they
    will now have no gates, but only themselves to keep. <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> has persistently advocated the reform. And now,
    Gentlemen, how about Mud Salad Market, which, like Scotland in
    <i>Macbeth's</i> time, "stands where it did"?</p>

    <p>DANTE NOT "IN IT"!&mdash;The Italian language is to be
    excluded from the Indian Civil Service Examination. "The story
    is extant, and written in very choice Italian," said
    <i>Hamlet</i>, and SHAKSPEARE knew that the reference would be
    intelligible to his audience. But <i>Hamlet</i> "up to date" in
    this "so-called nineteenth century" would be compelled to give
    the speech thus, "The original story, I believe, is written in
    the Italian language, with which none of us here are
    acquainted." But, after all, the candidates may be inclined to
    adapt the Gilbert-Sullivan words and music to the occasion, and
    sing&mdash;</p>

    <h2>THE WAY OF WESTMINSTER.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of the Parliamentary Bar.</i>)</h4>

    <p>"You will not forget, Sir," said my excellent and admirable
    clerk, "that to-morrow you have to appear before a Committee of
    the House of Commons, in the matter of the Glogsweller Railway
    Extension?"</p>

    <div class="figleft"

    <p>I glanced somewhat severely at PORTINGTON, but was gratified
    to find that his face was quite free from any suggestion of
    levity. I was the more pleased with the result of my
    investigation, as, truth to tell, the delivery of a brief in
    the matter of the Extension of the Glogsweller Railway Company
    had been somewhat of an event in my life. I had never before
    had the honour of practising at the Parliamentary Bar. So for
    months my mind had been entirely occupied with the date fixed
    for my appearance in the Committee Room of the House of
    Commons, known technically, I believe, at St. Stephens, as
    "upstairs."</p>

    <p>"You will be sure to meet me there, to-morrow, PORTINGTON?"
    I observed.</p>

    <p>"Certainly, Sir," replied my clerk. "But, as I have to be
    down at the Mayor's Court with Mr. CHARLES O'MULLIGAN in the
    morning, I daresay you won't mind if I come with your
    sandwiches and sherry, Sir, at two, or thereabouts."</p>

    <p>I acquiesced, somewhat unwillingly. O'MULLIGAN shares with
    me the good offices of PORTINGTON, but generally contrives to
    secure the lion's portion of his services. I had
    arranged&mdash;understanding that no adjournment was made for
    luncheon&mdash;that some refreshment should be conveyed to me
    during the day's proceedings, so that my voice should lose none
    of its wonted resonance (owing to famine-produced weakness)
    when the time arrived for my advocacy of the cause of my
    clients. Those clients had, so to speak, but a collateral
    interest in the day's proceedings. The great North-East
    Diddlesex Railway were promoting a Bill to carry a new line
    into the neighbourhood of the Glogsweller Extension, and my
    duty was confined to cross-examining one of the expert
    witnesses that I knew would be asked to support the G.N.E.D.R.
    To be candid, we had a goods depôt near their suggested
    terminus, and were fearful that their proposed proximity would
    damage our mineral traffic. The matter was simple enough, but I
    had taken months in carefully studying a small library of
    charts, Encyclopædias, and Parliamentary Blue Books, in
    mastering it.</p>

    <p>On the morning following my conversation with PORTINGTON,
    duly robed (I had put on my wig and gown in Chambers), I
    travelled by hansom to Westminster, and presented myself at the
    side entrance to St. Stephen's Hall. I had no difficulty in
    finding the Committee Room devoted to the consideration of the
    alleged necessities of the Great North-East Diddlesex Railway.
    It was a large and pleasant apartment, with a distant view
    through the windows of St. Thomas's Hospital. At a horse-shoe
    table sat the Committee, some four or five gentlemen, who might
    have filled equally appropriately any one of the pews reserved
    in the Royal Courts for the accommodation of a Special Jury. I
    took my place amongst a number of my learned brethren, who were
    perfect strangers to me. The table in front of us was littered
    with plans, charts, and documents of all descriptions. A Q.C.
    brought with him a large bag of buns, and two cups of custard,
    and there were other refreshments mingled with the exhibits
    before us. On chairs at the side were Solicitors; at our back,
    separated from us by a bar, were the Public. On the walls were
    hanging huge charts, giving in pantomimic proportions the
    proposed progress of the projected line. In the corners of
    these charts were explanations why such a part was coloured
    green, or red, or blue. During the day's proceedings an
    attendant was told off to trace the course of a counsel's
    harangue by pointing out, with a lecturer's wand, the various
    places referred to in his speech.</p>

    <p>I was gratified to find that the expert whose evidence it
    was my duty to test by cross-examination, was soon in the
    witness-box. He was a gentleman of considerable bulk, which
    gave one of my learned friends, who was the first to take him
    in hand, the opportunity of saying, that he was a "witness of
    great weight," a remark which caused much laughter&mdash;even
    the Chairman of the Committee, a somewhat austere person,
    indulging in a stealthy smile at the ingenious sally. Such
    waggish flashes as this, I need scarcely say, were most
    welcome, and afforded, when they came, a pleasant relief to the
    necessary dryness that characterised, perforce, the
    proceedings. As the hands of the clock progressed, waiters
    carried into the Committee, various light refreshments, such as
    brandy-and-sodawater, sandwiches, and buns. My colleagues, too,
    when not actively engaged in the declamatory duties of their
    profession, partook of the viands with which they had provided
    themselves before the commencement of the day's labours. Thus
    the cups devoted to custard soon were empty, and the paper
    bags, once occupied by buns, crumpled up and discarded. I gazed
    at the clock. It was past two, and I was getting terribly
    hungry. I felt that my voice was becoming weak from famine.
    This would never do, and might endanger my clients' interests.
    I looked round eagerly for PORTINGTON. He was nowhere to be
    seen. I whispered to a colleague, "would the
    examination-in-chief last much longer?" and was told it could
    not possibly be concluded within a quarter of an hour. I made
    up my mind to hasten to a refreshment-bar I had seen in the
    corridor before I had entered the room, and hurriedly left my
    seat. I pushed my way through the public, and had scarcely got
    outside when I found my faithful clerk laden with sandwiches
    and sherry making post-haste towards me.</p>

    <p>"Get back, Sir, as quick as you can," he cried, as he thrust
    the invigorating ingredients of my midday meal into my hands;
    "run, Sir, run; I hope they haven't noticed your absence!"</p>

    <p>Rather offended at the peremptory tone adopted by my
    subordinate I returned to my seat, and was pleased to find that
    the examination-in-chief was nearly ended. I pulled myself
    together. I drank a glass of sherry and finished a sandwich. My
    voice was in excellent tone, and I felt that the crisis of my
    life had indeed been reached. I knew that it was now or never.
    I had this great chance of distinguishing myself by pleasing my
    clients and securing a practice at the Parliamentary Bar, which
    might mean hundreds, nay, thousands a-year. I imagined my
    children at Eton, my wife in a carriage and pair, my address in
    Grosvenor Place. All I had to do to secure these
    tardily-attained luxuries was to protect my clients by my
    careful attention to their interests. The moment at length
    arrived. I rose to cross-examine.</p>

    <p>"And now, Sir," I said; feeling that I was master of the
    situation, and that my voice had a magnificent resonance, which
    was striking terror into the heart of the witness before me,
    <i>I</i> am going to put a few questions to you!"</p>

    <p>"I beg pardon," said the Chairman, promptly&mdash;"you will
    do nothing of the sort. You were not present during the
    <i>whole</i> of the witness's examination-in-chief, and so we
    decline to hear you!"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I could have wept! The momentary search for sandwiches and
    sherry had ruined me! Eton and Grosvenor Place vanished
    together (in the carriage and pair) for ever!</p>

    </div>

    <p>Once upon a time there existed two fatherless and motherless
    orphans, who were just old enough to work for their living.
    Unfortunately they did not know how to dig, were too proud to
    beg, and had conscientious scruples that prevented them from
    stealing. Besides, one of the two was a girl; and there were
    not many openings for her. And matters would have gone very
    hard with them, indeed, had not a distant, but benevolent
    relative, kindly died and left them as a legacy a sum of money,
    of which they were to have the interest until they attained
    their majority, when it was to be divided equally between them.
    They were overjoyed, and rushed to the executor, who happened
    to be a lawyer.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the man of costs, "I am indeed charged with the
    execution of the trust, and for your own sakes I hope you will
    not give me much trouble, as I shall, under the conditions of
    the will, have to make you pay for it."</p>

    <p>And after he had entered their visit (which he called an
    attendance) in his diary, to be subsequently copied into a
    ledger, he bowed them out.</p>

    <p>So the two orphans disappeared a little crestfallen; and
    they soon discovered that their legacy had the faculty of
    diminishing. The lawyer immediately transferred the money,
    which was invested in what he called "second-rate securities,"
    into Consols, and this cost something, and considerably
    diminished their income. When the two orphans remonstrated, the
    lawyer said, that as he made scarcely more than out-of-pocket
    expenses in the matter, he did not feel justified in incurring
    the slightest risk.</p>

    <p>"I am only a simple girl," murmured one of the orphans, with
    a nervous blush; "but does not a recent statute give trustees
    power to invest the funds of their <i>cestui que</i> trusts in
    securities yielding a larger return than 2¾ Goschens?"</p>

    <p>"Do not bandy words with me, Miss," replied the lawyer,
    angrily; "I shall act as I please, and if you or I ask for the
    estate to be administered, it will cost you a pretty
    penny."</p>

    <p>"Which no doubt will find its way into your pocket,"
    returned the maiden, simply. "But surely a 4½ mortgage on real
    property can be obtained without risk, if you do not act
    contrary to the provisions of the Trustee Relief Act?"</p>

    <p>But the lawyer was very angry, and threatened her that if
    she made any further complaint he would appeal to the Chancery
    Division of the High Court of Justice, which would mean,
    probably, the absorption of the entire estate in a gigantic
    bill of costs.</p>

    <p>So, with a sigh, the maiden and her brother retired. That
    night, as she was sitting over the fire, before retiring to
    rest, she had a dream, when a nice-looking old gentleman
    appeared before her, and asked her "why she was so sad?"</p>

    <p>"Because we have a lawyer for our trustee, who is most
    unobliging, and expensive. I am afraid, kind Sir, <i>you</i>
    cannot help us."</p>

    <p>"Do not say so until you have perused this scroll," he
    replied, with a benevolent smile, and he gave her a paper.
    "To-morrow, if your trustee again threatens you, and offers to
    retire, take him at his word. If I replace him, I will do all
    you wish&mdash;enter into mortgages, invest your capital to the
    best possible advantage, and make myself generally
    amiable."</p>

    <p>"But how shall we pay you for so much kindness?" asked the
    now overjoyed maiden.</p>

    <p>"By a tariff fixed by the Government. It will be my duty to
    do my best for you, and I shall have no personal interest in
    running up costs like the common (or garden) kind of family
    Solicitor."</p>

    <p>So the next day, when the lawyer began to threaten to
    resign, the orphans took him at his word, and all that the

    the orphans were getting the best possible interest for their
    money, at a trifling expense, the maiden looked at the scroll

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>More about DICKENS. By the loving hand of PERCY FITZGERALD
    the Bookmaker,&mdash;not sporting, but literary. Of making
    books, with PERCY FITZ there is no end. He is the king of the
    Bookmakers, <i>Per se Fitz</i>. This time it is the <i>History
    of the Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club</i>, published by
    CHAPMAN AND HALL, and "inscribed"&mdash;why not
    "dedicated?"&mdash;to HENRY FIELDING DICKENS, son of "The Only
    One," the Master. <i>Interesting?</i> Of course it is, anything
    about DICKENS, specially in connection with the immortal
    <i>Pickwick</i>, must be interesting, and for chatty, gossiping
    bookmaking we only say, "Give us Fitz." He is to the manor
    born. He is neither romancer nor poet: "<i>poeta nascitur
    non</i> 'Fitz.'" Occasionally FITZ is aggravatingly reticent.
    For instance, at page 16 we read, "<i>Two or three years
    ago</i>"&mdash;which? two or three?&mdash;"<i>a curious and
    amusing coincidence brought the author's son, a barrister in
    good practice</i>"&mdash;Which son? His name? There were more
    sons than one: were they all barristers? And was this one the
    only one in good practice?&mdash;"<i>into connection with his
    father's famous book. It occurred at a trial on the
    Circuit.</i>" Which Circuit? Which is "<i>the</i> Circuit"? The
    Baron, who is now the Last of the Barons but one, only asks
    because the phrase "on Circuit" would not have required his
    query; but "on the Circuit" is another pair of shoes. "<i>A
    trial</i>." What trial? When? At p. 17, "<i>The Judge entered
    into the humour of the thing</i>"&mdash;what Judge? The Baron
    is of opinion that in the well-known advertisement about the
    Waverley Pen, quoted in a note at p. 25, the correct order
    should be, "<i>The Pickwick, the Owl, and the Waverley
    Pen</i>"&mdash;not Pickwick last. Did CHARLES DICKENS ever
    write to FORSTER that he was "<i>getting on like a house o'
    fire"?</i> Surely this should be a "house a-fire," or "a house
    on fire"; for a "house o' fire" means a "house of fire," which
    is not what the expression is intended to convey. At p. 51, in
    a note, FITZ says, "'<i>Phiz, Whizz,' or something of that
    kind, was</i> T. HOOD's <i>joke</i>." Was it? If so, where does
    the joke come in?</p>

    <p>My friend, the late GEORGE ROSE, better known as "ARTHUR
    SKETCHLEY," used to say that DICKENS took <i>Sam Weller</i>
    from (as I understood him) a character in one of O'KEEFE's
    comedies. This statement was given on the authority of Mr.
    BAYLE BERNARD. But I am bound to say I can find nothing like
    <i>Sam</i> in O'KEEFE's; but I have found DICKENS there bodily.
    It is in Sc. 1, Act I. of <i>Life's Vagaries; or, The Neglected
    Son.</i> "'Oh!' exclaims FANNY, 'if my papa was to see
    me&mdash;oh!' (<i>Seeing</i> DICKENS, <i>runs; he stops
    her.</i>)" And, oddly enough, in this edition of 1798,
    frequently as the above-mentioned character appears, it is "on
    this occasion only" that the name is spelt with an "E."</p>

    <p>Mr. FITZGERALD, at p. 136 of this book, says, that an actor
    named SAM VALE, appearing as <i>Simon Splatterdash</i>, in a
    piece called <i>The Boarding-House</i>, was in the habit of
    "interlarding his conversation with metaphorical
    illustrations"&mdash;and then follow the examples. <i>The
    Boarding-House</i>, however, is not by O'KEEFE, but, as appears
    from a note in <i>Sketches by Boz</i>, was being performed when
    DICKENS's short tale of <i>The Boarding-House</i> appeared. For
    my part, I long ago came to the conclusion that <i>Sam
    Weller</i> was absolutely an original creation, as far, that
    is, as anything outside the immaterial realms of fancy and
    fairyland can be an original creation. Our FITZ gives
    CALVERLEY's Examination Paper, and also an Oxford imitation of
    it, which, however, is not by any means up to the
    CALVERLEY-BLADES mark. There is also a preface to
    <i>Pickwick</i>, specially interesting, as not being found in
    later editions. Then our Fitz informs us how many dramatic
    versions of <i>Pickwick</i> there have been, some with and some
    without music, bringing the list down to the latest "Dramatic
    Cantata" (it oughtn't to have been so described, as there was
    dialogue in it), the music of which will always hold a first
    place among the compositions of the Musical Baron's friend
    claiming to be the gifted descendant of the Wise and Musical
    King SOLOMON.</p>

    <p>Altogether a vote of thanks should be presented to Mr. PERCY
    FITZGERALD for his entertaining, instructive, and most readable
    book on the immortal <i>Pickwick</i>, says</p>

    <h2>TALKING BY TIME.</h2>

    <p>The growing pressure of the business having already obliged
    the Belgium Postal Authorities to cut down the time allowed for
    a telephonic communication between Paris and Brussels, from
    five minutes to three, it is to be presumed that the rush of
    public patronage that may be expected when the wire is opened
    between London and the French Capital, will soon necessitate
    the substitution, in place of the promised ten minutes, of an
    allowance to each speaker of a minute, or at most a minute and
    a half for his interview, which it may confidently be expected
    will not unfrequently take the following shape:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Inexorable Official</i>. Now, Sir; your turn next.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Shuts intending</i> London Talker <i>in, and
        switches him "on."</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. Dear me! How quick they are, one
    hardly knows what one is about. I wonder how loud, now, one
    ought to speak. Better shout. Anyhow, I'll try that first.
    (<i>At the top of his voice through the tube.</i>) Hullo! Hi! I
    say. Are you there?</p>

    <p><i>Paris Listener</i> (<i>replying</i>). Oh! don't bawl like
    that. Of course I'm here, I've been waiting quite half a
    minute; thought you were never going to begin. But I suppose it
    is JONES I am speaking to?</p>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. Oh yes, I'm JONES. It's all right. But
    can't you recognise my voice?</p>

    <p><i>Paris Listener</i>. Not when you bawl fit to break the
    drum of one's ear. But come, now, get on quick with what you
    want to say.</p>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. All right&mdash;I'll get on. But now
    tell me, do I pitch my voice about right now? Can you catch
    distinctly all I say?</p>

    <p><i>Paris Listener</i>. Oh yes! Bother! But do get on.
    Timesgoifast.</p>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. What? I didn't catch that last word.
    Time's what?</p>

    <p><i>Paris Listener</i> (<i>very distinctly, with
    emphasis</i>). I
    said&mdash;that&mdash;time&mdash;was&mdash;going fast. Can you
    hear that?</p>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. Oh yes, I can hear that, and most
    distinctly. Really, it is a most wonderful invention.</p>

    <p><i>Paris Listener</i>. Oh, bother the invention! Do come to
    business! What did you want me for?</p>

    <p><i>London Talker</i>. Oh. of course. Well, it was just this.
    I thought&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Inexorable Official</i>. Time's up, Sir. Trouble you to
    make room for this Lady.</p>

    <p>There is an uncomfortably blood-thirsty look about this

    real Sport. For it is to be presumed that she intends her
    well-cared for pet literally to do the unhappy sparrows to
    death in the most approved fashion. How will she manage it?
    Clip their wings, and set them on the drawing-room floor; or
    tie strings to their legs, and let the favourite cat "go for
    them?" Cats must be fed. But it is not necessary to provide
    them with a "Supply of Live Sparrows" twice, or even once. We

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>March 10</i>.&mdash;It has come at last, and I'm free to
    confess I don't care for it half as much as I thought I should.
    I got the letter five days ago. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="author">45, <i>Main Street, Billsbury, March</i> 4,
    18&mdash;.</p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have been in communication with headquarters,
    and I am informed that you are looking out for a Constituency
    at the next General Election. We have been for some time past
    endeavouring to find a Candidate for this Borough, and should
    be glad to hear if we may submit your name to the consideration
    of our local Council. The political history of Billsbury must
    be known to you. Up to the date of the last election we have
    always been represented by a Conservative. In fact, Billsbury
    was always looked upon as an impregnable fortress of sound
    Constitutional opinion.</p>

    <p>Our late Member, however, was unable to devote to the
    Constituency the time and attention it required. Moreover, I
    may mention in strict confidence, that his conduct over the
    Billsbury Main Drainage Scheme alienated a considerable number
    of his supporters, and the consequence was that at the last
    election Sir THOMAS CHUBSON, the Liberal Candidate and present
    Member for Billsbury, was elected by a majority of 279. Since
    then, however, the Party has rallied, the divisions in our
    ranks have been healed, the registrations have been very much
    in our favour, and there is no reason to doubt that, as soon as
    Billsbury has the chance, she will return to her ancient
    allegiance. I shall be in London the day after to-morrow
    (Thursday, March 6), and shall do myself the honour of calling
    upon you. Kindly let me know where and when I can see you. I
    shall be glad to afford you any further information.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours faithfully, JAMES TOLLAND,</p>

    <p class="author"><i>To</i> RICHARD B. PATTLE, Esq.,
    <i>President Billsbury Conservative Association. Dr. Johnson
    Buildings, Temple, E.C.</i></p>

    <p>I dashed off at once to the Central Association. They urged
    me to accept, and told me that even if I failed, which they
    said was extremely unlikely, my fight would give me "an
    irresistible claim on the Party." Afterwards saw VULLIAMY, the
    Member for one of the Pinkshire Divisions. He said "Take it? Of
    course you must. Ridiculous to hesitate. A youngster like you,
    who only left College four years ago, ought to be proud of the
    chance. If you're beaten you'll have a claim on the Party, and
    mind you don't let 'em forget it. Curse them, they never think
    of a man's valuable services if he doesn't keep on reminding
    them himself;" and then he drivelled on for a quarter of an
    hour about all he'd done for the Party, and how "the shabby
    beggars" had refused his nephew the Morterton Recordership. It
    seems the other side manage their business much better. Next I
    called on Uncle HENRY in the City. He said he'd stick to his
    promise of paying half my expenses, but wouldn't help me to
    nurse the place. However, I daresay that won't cost much.
    Eventually wrote to Old TOLLAND, and asked him to call at my
    Chambers on Thursday at 3 o'clock. Then went home and told my
    mother. She said, "My darling boy, I knew you would be
    distinguished. I knew it all along. If your dear father had
    only lived, he would have been a proud man to-day. Now, mind
    you have that horrid grating removed from the Ladies' Gallery."
    And with that she kissed me and rang for cook to tell her the
    news. I sloped.</p>

    <p>On Thursday Old TOLLAND called. It seems he's an Alderman,
    and I only addressed him as plain Esquire. He wanted to know,
    What were my views on the Labour Question? Was I an Eight
    Hours' man? How about Vaccination and Woman's Suffrage? and all
    kinds of other rubbish. I had to beat about a good deal, and
    answer generally, but at last I consented to address the
    Council, and to-morrow was fixed as the day. If accepted, I
    shall have to come before a Mass Meeting, and go through it all
    again. It all seems rather roundabout, but I suppose it's the
    usual way.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 23</i>.&mdash;Easter
    Holidays begin to-morrow; to-night last rally round RAIKES;
    Postmaster harried from both sides of House; the Contumacious
    COBB begins it; comments on Coroner's conduct beginning to pall
    on accustomed appetite; references to delicate investigation in
    judicial circles falling flat; so turns upon
    POSTMASTER-GENERAL. Wants to know about the Boy Messengers?
    Pack in full cry; RAIKES pelted with newspapers, assailed with
    over-weighted letters; late at night CAMERON comes up quite
    fresh, desiring to "call attention to the position taken up by
    the POSTMASTER-GENERAL with regard to the Electric Call and Boy
    Messenger System," just as if he had at the moment made the
    discovery.</p>

    <p>In course of lecture CAMERON produces sort of pocket-pistol;
    explains it's the thing you work the electric call with. You
    press a button here, and up comes a tumbler of milk and soda;
    another button, and you have a sausage and a hot potato; a
    third, and your boots are suddenly pulled off by an unseen
    agency; a fourth, and you find yourself seated in a hansom cab,
    with eighteenpence pressed into your hand to pay your fare
    withal; a fifth, and you're awakened at four o'clock in the
    morning with an apology. Something, you learn, went wrong with
    the machine, and it was the gentleman on the next floor who
    ought to have been called at this hour.</p>

    <p>GANE, Q.C., with hands folded on knees, sat entranced,
    listening to this interesting narrative, and watching the
    illustrations rapidly produced by CAMERON, as he touched the
    various buttons.</p>

    <p>"Wonderful!" cried GANE, Q.C. "Never knew anything like it
    since I read <i>Arabian Nights</i>."</p>

    <p>"What's RAIKES' loss is our GANE," says WILFRID LAWSON.</p>

    <p>Must think this over during the Recess.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/168-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/168-2.png"
             alt="The Pillary Post." /></a>The Pillary Post.
    </div>

    <p>For awhile RAIKES had peace; quite forgotten whilst House,
    falling into GANE's attitude, listened to CAMERON's fairy
    tale.</p>

    <p>"It's only postponed, TOBY," he said, wearily, CAMERON
    (having accidentally touched the wrong button) being promptly
    carried off to bed in the middle of a sentence; "they'll be at
    me again to-morrow, and will begin once more, like giants
    refreshed, when they come back from the holidays. It's an old
    story; the House of Commons must always have its whipping-boy.
    Don't know whether you've sat long enough for Barks to remember
    AYRTON? A dead set was made against him, and he was not only
    driven out of office, but forth from public life. It's
    generally the HOME SECRETARY who is fastened on. There was
    WALPOLE, chronically reduced to tears. BRUCE was chivied by the
    cabmen, and had his hat blocked by the publicans. The blameless
    HARCOURT didn't go scot free whilst he was at the Home Office.
    MATTHEWS has had a long run, with the hounds after him. Now
    they've turned aside from him, and are yelping after me. It's
    very well for MATTHEWS, but a little worrying for me. Of course
    I don't claim to be perfect. As HARCOURT once admitted of
    himself, I'm almost human, I try to do my duty, and protect the
    interests of Department committed to my charge. They come in
    touch with all classes, and naturally there is friction. Just
    now the howling is persistent, and, I fancy, organised. Perhaps
    it'll fall away by-and-by. In the meanwhile, it's rather
    wearing, so pitilessly monotonous. As you said the other day, a
    new constitutional maxim has been established. Once OLD
    MORALITY used to write in his copybook, 'The QUEEN can Do no
    Wrong.' Now he may add this other, 'The POSTMASTER-GENERAL Does
    Nothing Right.'" <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Miscellaneous.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:26%;">
        <a href="images/168-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/168-3.png"
             alt="'Stole Away!'" /></a>"Stole Away!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Tuesday Afternoon</i>.&mdash;Winding up business before
    holiday; rather a scramble at the end. OLD MORALITY, as usual,
    piled up heap of work to be got through. "Quite easy, you
    know," he said. "Tithes Bill, Electoral Disabilities Removal
    Bill, Savings Bank Bill, take them in your stride. What does
    the poet say? Line upon Line; Little by Little; Here to-day and
    gone To-morrow. Those are the sound economical principles that
    should guide a man through life."</p>

    <p>At one time seemed that whilst we were certainly here
    to-day, we wouldn't be gone till to-morrow. Tithe Bill in last
    stage took a lot of fighting over. House wouldn't have
    Electoral Disabilities Removal Bill or the Savings Bank Bill at
    any price.</p>

    <p>"Then I'll move the adjournment," paid OLD MORALITY, in
    despair.</p>

    <p>"Not till you've heard my speech," said Dr. CLARK; pulled
    out manuscript from breast coat-pocket, began descanting on the
    under-pay of Civil Servants in Scotland, whilst TYSSEN AMHERST
    folded his tent like the Arab, and as silently stole away.
    Example followed generally by Members in all parts of the
    House. CLARK thoroughly enjoying himself, composedly went on to
    end of speech, and then adjournment. SPEAKER "kept in" till
    Thursday to take part in ceremony of Royal Commission. Rest
    off, and won't be back till Monday, 6th of April.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Wound up for Easter
    Holidays.</p>

    <h2>CRITICISING THE CALENDAR.</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;The suggestion of your Correspondent "EASTER
    EGG," who wishes Easter to be a fixed festival, always coming
    on April 20, is excellent. At present, Easter-tide, like the
    other tide, depends on the moon. What a humiliating confession!
    Why should we any longer consent to be the slaves of the
    (so-called) Science of Astronomy?</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, REFORMING SPIRIT.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;What's all this fuss about Easter being too early
    this year? It isn't half early enough. It ought to have come
    last Christmas, and Whitsuntide the same, and then we should
    have polished off three public holiday seasons&mdash;public
    nuisances, <i>I</i> call them,&mdash;at once.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, gloomily, TRUE PHILANTHROPIST.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I have just been horrified to hear that one of my
    boys now at home from school remains with us for a three weeks'
    vacation! The early date of Easter is the paltry excuse offered
    by his Headmaster for this infliction. Anybody can see through
    such a flimsy pretext. His brother is to have <i>his</i>
    holiday four weeks later. The result is that the boys will see
    nothing of each other during their holidays, while their
    parents will see a great deal too much. How can brotherly
    affection&mdash;I say nothing of fatherly affection,&mdash;that
    priceless blessing, which I flatter myself I always
    conspicuously display&mdash;be expected to continue under these
    depressing conditions?</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, exasperatedly, FOND PARENT.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;As peeple are riting lettres to you about the
    Easter holy-days, I should like you to put in what old
    BOREHAM&mdash;he's our Principul&mdash;has been doing. We all
    think it a thundring shame. He kept us grinding away right
    through Good Friday, Easter Monday, and means us to go on
    several weeks afterwards! The result was we had about half a
    Hot Cross-Bun each! Old BOREHAM akshally fixed Easter Monday
    for going over all the Latin irreglur verbs. Pleese would you
    say something in your valyble collums about old BOREHAM, and
    oblige</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, obedjiently, SMITH (<i>Tertius</i>),
    <i>Rodchester</i>.</p>

    whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any
    description, will in no case be returned, not even when

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
